# Customer_Churn_Prediction

#### Jason Wu  -- 2022/06/15

Predicting potiential customers who are likely to churn is very important for every company. Therefore, in this project, I use different supervised machine learning models to identify customers who are likely to churn in the future. Furthermore, I analyze top factors that influence user retention. 
The dataset is here: [Dataset information](https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers). For code, please check the [Python Notebook](Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb).
